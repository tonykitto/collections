<h2>Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museum - Collections Displays - August 2016</h2>

<div class="display_link"><p>This web site displays part of Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museum's fine arts collection taken from Towneley's Modes xml files. You can curate your own exhibition by selecting individual objects from these pages and adding your own labels, see <a href="my_exhibition.html">My Exhibition</a>.</p>
<p>More than half of Towneley's sculpture and oil paintings are normally on public display but over 1,000 watercolours and book illustrations in the permanent collections are kept in store. Whilst parts of the collection are regularly displayed, care is taken not display any individual painting too often in order to preserve them from fading.</p>

<div class="display_link"><p><b>Landseer prints</b> were some of the earliest additions to the collections with over 100 donated in 1905 but by 1920 the prints were considered unfashionable and were loaned out to local schools. Many were damaged but 61 are still in the collection.</p>
