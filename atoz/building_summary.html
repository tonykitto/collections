		<p>When Burnley Corporation took over in 1902 the Borough Surveyor reported the building was in a bad state of repair. The repairs required then and subsequent changes necessary to turn Towneley Hall into an Art Gallery and Museum are recorded in  two entries  <a href="repairs.html">repairs</a> and <a href="changes.html">changes</a>. These changes and repairs have continued right up to the present with a  <a href="https://towneley.org.uk/about/towneley-hall-repairs/">programme of major repairs</a> to Towneley Hall taking place from October 2022 and hoping to be completed in early 2025.</p>
		<p>Towneley has buildings around three sides of a courtyard,  the <a href="wings.html">North and South wings</a> connected by the <a href="great_hall.html">Great Hall</a>, but before around 1712 there was a fourth side containing the chapel, now part of the North wing. One of Burnley Corporation's first actions in 1902 was to make a <a href="heating_plan.html">heating plan</a>, which shows all the rooms as they were before the Corporation began to make changes, an A to Z entry <a href="room_names.html">Room Names</a> . </p>
		<p><b>New wing</b><br>Entry to the museum is via the <a href="museum_shop.html">Museum Shop</a> in the new wing.</p><p>Display rooms are divided into themes: Life In The Hall and Collections. The Life In The Hall displays relate to the Towneley family and the history of the building at various points in the hall's history.</p>
		<p>Visitors are free to choice their own route through the display rooms around the building. There is also the option to take a <a href="guided_tour.html">guided tour</a> that includes the cellars and the area above the Great Hall. An <a href="outside_tour.html">outside tour</a> is also an option. A separate Museum of Local History is situated behind the New Wing in the 18th century <a href="brew_house.html">Brew House</a>.</p>
