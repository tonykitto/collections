<section class="column">
<p>Nine antique Persian rugs were purchased from Needhams Ltd. Manchester between 1924 and 1931 to furnish the Long Gallery bedrooms and dining room. In 1973, ten rugs were added to the <a href="accession_registers.html">accession registers</a>, given the object numbers R1 to R10 but is not possible to identify any as being the ones purchased from Needhams Ltd. At that time only two were described as being in good condition, with two others being in fair condition. In recent years three have been left on the floor in two of the Long Gallery bedrooms and Family dining room but not in such a way as to display them. The rest have been stored or destroyed. None have been photographed and they have not been added to the Modes database.</p>
