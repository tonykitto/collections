<h1>Accreditation</h1>
<section class="column">
 <p>Towneley aims to meet standards for UK museums set by the Arts Council's <a href=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/accreditation-scheme/about-accreditation>Accreditation Scheme</a>. The purpose of the scheme is <b>to help all museums to be sustainable, focused and trusted organisations, which offer their visitors a great experience</b>.</p>
<p>The accreditation system was first set up by the Museums & Galleries Commission in 1988 and Towneley was granted full registered status in 1989.</p>
 <p>The A to Z entries cover how Towneley's collections are documented but avoids all details of current financial and security matters. A particular aim is to identify how the paper documents and computer system records relate to <a href=http://collectionstrust.org.uk/spectrum/>Spectrum</a>, the collection management standard developed by the <a href=http://collectionstrust.org.uk/>Collections Trust</a>. </p>
