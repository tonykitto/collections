<h1>Commemorative Medallions</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>There are around 320 medallions that commemorate local or national events. They are normally in store. </p><p>Among the earliest gifts were three cases of facsimile English historical medallions loaned by the British Museum in 1903, which the <a href="sub-committee.html">Sub-committee</a> requested to be donated at the end of the <a href="first_exhibition.html">first exhibition</a>. (It is not clear if these were donated at the time but they were listed in exhibition catalogues from 1920.) </p><p>About a third of the collection commemorate royal events from the golden jubilee of King George III in 1809 to the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977.</p><p>The collection was formally recorded in the <a href="accession_registers.html">accession registers</a> around 1968 with more additions up to 1989 but as of August 2016 only part of this collection has been added to the Modes database along with <a href="../cms/cms_med.html">military medals</a>. </p>
