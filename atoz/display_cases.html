<h1>Display cases</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Although not considered part of the Permanent Collection, display cases have always been a vital part of the museum. The museum sub-committee recommended spending Â£400 on display cases in December 1902 and in May 1903 had to recommend spending more money on an additional case for the mummy's coffin. Some objects have particular requirements for display, a good example being the Whalley Abbey vestments. The changing needs of the museum sometimes requires new display cases as can be shown by the contribution from Towneley Hall Society of 3 oak display cases for the Local History Museum in 2022.</p>
<p>The 1938 catalogue <a href="inventories--catalogues.html"><b>[md7a]</b></a> included over 70 display cases in use at that time excluding over 100 bird cases. All of these display cases have long been replaced but the cases made for the East Lancashire Regiment Collection in 1948 are still in use in the Military Room. There are still a number of the old bird cases in the Natural History Store.</p>
