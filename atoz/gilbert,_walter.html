<section class="column">
  <p>Walter Gilbert (1871-1946) was an English sculptor who was responsible for the <a href=https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/2050>Burnley War Memorial</a> in Towneley Park and for <a href="../cms/cms_SCU.html?~WalterGilbert">two bronze busts</a> of <a href="massey_bequest.html">Edward Stocks Massey</a> and <a href="o'hagan,_lady.html">Lady O'Hagan</a>.</p>
 <p>The busts were commissioned by the Towneley sub-committee as replacements after they had rejected two busts commissioned from Alfred Gilbert, which had been arranged by Walter Gilbert. Eventually the sub-committee relented and purchased the rejected work by <a href="gilbert,_alfred.html">Alfred Gilbert</a>. For a detailed account of Walter Gilbert's work see an entry in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Walter_Gilbert>Wikipedia</a>.</p>
