He was the nephew of Thomas Gainsborough. On 14 January 1772 he entered his uncle's studio, where he remained until 1788. Although Dupont's technique was more frenetic, his palette more varied and his draughtsmanship weaker, scholars have only recently been able to separate Dupont's work from that of his uncle.</p></details>
