<p>In 1901, <a href="o'hagan,_lady.html">Lady O'Hagan</a> purchased the Pyrgo Park Estate, Havering, Essex. That is where most of the family portraits, sculpture and furniture went after she left Towneley Hall in 1902. </p><p>Pyrgo Park had a rich history with royal connections but the house itself was built in the 19th century. The picture above, from a sales catalogue of 1919, shows the picture gallery,added to the house by Lady O'Hagan in 1905. (The sales catalogue, on loan from the O'Hagan family, is stored in the Library.)</p><p>The house was eventually sold by <a href="o'hagan,_maurice.html">Maurice O'Hagan</a> in 1925. It was demolished by Essex Council around 1940 (see <a href=http://www.lostheritage.org.uk/houses/lh_essex_pyrgopark.html>lost country houses</a>). Five marble busts returned to Towneley on loan in August 1926 but the family portraits were moved to Ickworth Lodge in Suffolk before most of them were sold in 1939. </p>
