<p>Summary: over 400 items, mostly given by <a href="o'hagan,_lady.html">Lady O'Hagan</a> and <a href="garstang,_j.html">Prof. John Garstang</a> between 1903 and 1905, collection now closed.</p><p>The collection includes a mummy, two mummy cases, alabaster, ceramics and wooden items incuding a model boat. The earliest part of the collection arrived at Towneley in October 1902 from Lady O'Hagan. The mummy and case, together with a representative part of the collection are on display in the <a href="collectors_room.html">Collectors Room</a>.</p><p>In the 1970s a set of index cards was created but the collection was not added to the <a href="accession_registers.html">Accession Registers</a> as there had been no changes to the collection since it  was recorded in 1938 catalogue ( <a href="inventories--catalogues.html"><b>md7a</b></a> ). </p><p>In 2012, the collection was re-catalogued by students from the University of Liverpool Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, but in 2016 the collection had not yet been added to the Modes database.</p>
