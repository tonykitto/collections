<h1>Amato, Gennaro d' (1857-1947)</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Gennaro d' Amato (1857-1947) gave his painting of The Jubilee of Queen Victoria at St. Paul's [<a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?paoil13">paoil13</a>] to Towneley in memory of his son Joseph in 1905. For more detail of the painting see <a href="https://vads.ac.uk/digital/collection/NIRP/id/32540">Nice Paintings</a> but note that it mistakenly records the painting was purchased from the artist by Mr John Bradley.</p>
<details><summary>This note taken from the Burnley Gazette of January 25th 1905 records the gift -</summary>
<p>At a recent meeting of the Art Gallery and Museum Sub-Committee of the Corporation, a letter was read from Mr. John Bradley, auctioneer, Burnley, stating that M. D'Amato, an Italian artist, had offered to present to the Corporation, for the permanent art gallery at Towneley Hall, a picture, entitled "The Jubilee of Queen Victoria at St. Paul's Cathedral". It was resolved that the Council be recommended to accept the offer, and that Mr. Bradley be requested to convey to M. D'Amato the best thanks of the Corporation for his gift. The picture is about 6 feet in length.</p>
<p>M. D'Amato, who lives in Genoa and who is a friend of Mr. Bradley, was sent as a special artist by Sir William Ingram, proprietor of the "Illustrated London News" to paint pictures of the Queen's Jubilee Celebrations in 1887. He was also commissioned for a similar purpose, by Sir W. Ingram, on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Sir William being desirous of presenting the picture to the late Queen. M. D'Amato drew a sketch which pleased Sir William, who however,
asked that the figure of the Queen should be made more prominent. a picture was painted from this sketch, and presented to Queen Victoria, who gave it to the nation and it now hangs in Buckingham
Palace. [see below]</p><p> Afterwards at Sir William's request M. D'Amato painted a picture from the first sketch, and it is this which is to be presented to Burnley. It was on exhibition in Manchester about 1900 and at the close of the exhibition was hung at the offices of the "Illustrated London News". The offices have recently been sold by the owner, who apprised M. D'Amato of the fact. and he in turn wrote to Mr Bradley, stating that as this was an English subject, painted for England, it ought to remain in this country. As Burnley was the only place in England where he had English friends, he though he would like to give it to Burnley, more particularly as his late son, Joseph, had spent so many happy days here. As a memorial of his late son, he would have great pleasure in giving it to the Corporation of Burnley, if they would accept it.</p></details>
<p>It seems the second painting (see above newspaper report), in which the Queen was made more prominent, was not given to the Queen as it is now in the Government Art Collection, having been purchased from Sir Bruce Ingram in 1952. Sir Bruce Ingram was the second son of Sir William Ingram and took over the London Illustrated News in 1900.</p>
