<section class="column">
<img alt="cantilever staircase" title="cantilever staircase" src="images/rooms/TR0403.jpg"/><p>The cantilever staircase runs up the second floor of the <a href="south_tower.html">South Tower</a> to the <a href="long_gallery.html">Long Gallery</a>. The South Tower was built around 1620 but the cantilever staircase, thought to be by Robert Bakewell of Derbyshire, was added one hundred years later. </p><p>Before Towneley was opened to the public in May 1903, a gate was added at the foot of the staircase and the balustrades and landings were strengthened. </p>
