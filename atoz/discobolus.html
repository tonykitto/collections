<h1>The Townley Discobolus</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discobolus">Discobolus</a> ("discus thrower") is a lost Greek sculpture known through numerous Roman copies. <a href="charles_townley_(1737-1805).html">Charles Townley (1737-1805)</a> purchased a copy found in Rome in 1791. The Townley Discobolus arrived at his home in Park Street, Westminster in 1794 and <a href="zoffany.html">Zoffany</a> updated the painting of "Charles Townley and friends in his library" to include it in 1798.</p>
<p> The sculpture is now in the <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1805-0703-43">British Museum</a>, which has published a book by Ian Jenkins all about it. This book tells the story of Myron's Discobolus both as an archaeological artefact and bearer of meaning. Focusing on the Townley Discobolus, the Roman marble copy excavated from Hadrian's Villa in Lazio, Italy, this illustrated introduction explores the history and significance of the statue – in both classical and modern times – in light of ancient discus throwing, Myron's other works, and the artistic, intellectual and philosophical context of the Greek world. The work has frequently been loaned out around the world to co-incide with the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>A <a href="../cms/cms_SCU.html?scu64">cast</a> of the Townley Discobolus, made by Andrew Lendzion, was purchased by the Towneley Hall Society and presented to Towneley to mark their 50th anniversary in 2015. It is a duplicate copy of one purchased by the British Museum, which they have displayed when the original was out on loan.</p>
