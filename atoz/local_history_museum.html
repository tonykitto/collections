<h1>Local History Museum</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>The social, industrial and local history collection was planned in the 1960s when much of central Burnley - like other northern towns - was being demolished to make way for new developments and various exhibits were rescued from buildings due to be demolished. Many of the craftsmen's tools on display come from the last person carrying on that traditional trade in the district. The building behind the North Wing of Towneley Hall, known as the brew house, was restored and opened as the Museum of Local Crafts and Industries on Friday, April 30th, 1971. From 2002 it become known as the Local History Museum.</p>
