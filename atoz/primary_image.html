<h1>Primary Image</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Up until 2016, most objects in the museum's fine and decorative arts collections have been digitally photographed. Some of these objects have been carefully photographed by professional photographers for commercial publications. Some have numerous photographed to show all their details. In all cases, one particular photograph that best shows the object as a whole was used for insurance purposes.</p><p>In Towneley's <a href="documentation_system.html">documentation system</a>, this photograph is called the primary image and a jpeg version is given the same filename as the object's object number together with a caption that is a brief description of the object.</p><h3>Note </h3><p>In 2016, while almost all objects in the fine art collections had primary images with the same filename as the object name, this was not true for objects in the sculpture collection nor in the decorative arts collections. The sculpture collection was among the first objects digitally photographed in 2005 and these images included one or two leading zeros in the numeric part of the name, eg <b>scu009.jpg</b> for <b>scu9</b> and <b>scu049.jpg</b> for <b>scu49</b> . At that time Burnley Borough Council was still using an old version of Windows that used literal sorting where <b>scu10.jpg to scu19.jpg</b> would appear before <b>scu2 to scu9</b> etc., so using a leading zero would allow <b>scu02.jpg</b> to be listed before <b>scu10.jpg</b> . Later versions of Windows use numerical sorting with <b>scu2.jpg</b> being listed before <b>scu10.jpg</b> so there is no longer any purpose in including leading zeros.</p><p>Many objects in the ceramics collections shared one primary image, for example <b>po167.1-10</b> with one primary image <b>po167.jpg</b> . There are also many individual objects with two or more photographs using a suffix <b>a,b,c</b> etc. , where the primary image has the <b>a</b> suffix as in <b>poN255a.jpg</b> for <b>poN255</b>.</p>
