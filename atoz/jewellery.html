<p>There is a small jewellery collection, recorded as clothing accessories in the textiles inventory. The beads, brooches and necklaces amount to about 20 entries. A medieval gold posy ring was originally included in this group but in 2012 it was accessioned as <a href="../cms/cms_SILVER.html?ssp100"><b>ssp100</b></a> in the silver collection. It was found on the Towneley smallholdings near the Deer Pond in 1936. It is English, 15th century, and the inscription on the outside , "Ie Desire Amour" means "I desire love". On the inside of the ring is another inscription "Ie Voes Tiene Foi" which promises "I keep faith with you".</p>
