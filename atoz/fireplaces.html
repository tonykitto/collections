The fireplace in the Red drawing room was purchased from <a href="hayward.html">Richard Hayward(1728-1800)</a> by Charles Townley (1737-1805) in 1780. The fireplace in the Green drawing room is made from Mona marble, quarried in Anglesey. It was created by <a href="bullock.html">George Bullock (1783-1818)</a> and purchased for Towneley at the sale of his stock in trade in 1819. </p></section>
