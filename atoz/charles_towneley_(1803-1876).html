<img alt=" Colonel Charles Towneley" title=" Colonel Charles Towneley" src="images/Col_Charles_Ty.jpg"/><p>Charles Towneley (1803-1876) was the elder son of <a href="peregrine_edward_towneley_(1762-1846).html">Peregrine Edward Towneley (1762-1846)</a>. He planned to make substantial changes to Towneley Hall after he inherited in 1846 but eventually the only changes he made were to increase the accommodation by adding a four storey tower by the north corner of the North wing. For more details of changes at Towneley during his time see Chapter 6 Colonel Charles Towneley (1803-1876) And His Contribution To The Hall in "An Architectural History of Towneley Hall" by W. John and Kit Smith, published by Heritage Trust for the North West in 2004.</p><p>The main changes that Charles made at Towneley were improvements to the farm buildings when he established a herd of shorthorn cattle that achieved national fame with outstanding success at agricultural shows. He was also a successful racehorse owner, winning the Epsom Derby in 1861. The oil paintings collection include Charles together with his Derby winner <a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?paoil38">Kettledrum</a> and three paintings of his <a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?short horn">short horn cattle</a>. The most famous member of the herd, Royal Butterfly, is seen as a calf with his parents, Butterfly and Frederick in the painting <a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?paoil292">'Towneley Pedigres'</a>.</p>
