It then follows the route the servants would have taken during the 19th century back towards the <a href="kitchen.html">Kitchen</a> via the <a href="cellars.html">Cellars</a> and the passage that runs below the front of the Great Hall. Entry into the kitchen is an important part of the guided tour and can often take up a large part of the tour's allotted time. Depending upon the tour length, the tour normally continues by visiting the <a href="chapel.html">Chapel</a> and then up the <a href="jacobean_staircase.html">Jacobean staircase</a> and across to the <a href="long_gallery.html">Long Gallery</a> via the <a href="roof_area.html">Roof area</a> above the Great Hall.</p>
