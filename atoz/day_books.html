<h1>Day books</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>From September 1971 all objects entering Towneley was recorded into a notebook named the <b>day book</b> . Each entry was dated and given a sequential number beginning with year number. The object was either a purchase or a gift or a loan with a named vendor or donor or loanee. There was a short description of the object and optionally some action. Day books continued until July 2000 when an <a href="object_entry_form.html">object entry form</a> started to be used instead.  The museum archive includes four day books ( <b>md11, md12, md13, md64</b> ) These may still have some use in improving the collection catalogues, since some objects entered together in the day books are now in separate collections, for example war medals that were donated together with photographs of the medal's recipient.</p>
