<h1>Cabinet of Curiosities</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>The Cabinet of Curiosities is a large display case in the <a href="museum_shop.html">Museum Shop</a> providing a taster of what can be found in the museum.</p>
<p>An extract from the Welcome to Towneley Hall text states<br>
<q>As you explore the Hall you will find many reminders of the Towneley family, and discover plenty of wonderful (and some weird) things on display.</q></p>
<p>The display case contains a few of the things, mainly ethnographic, natural history and social history objects. It was created around 2013 in conjunction with the Lancashire Pennine Museums Project. </p>
