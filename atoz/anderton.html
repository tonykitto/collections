<h1>Thomas Anderton (1675-1741)</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Rev. Thomas Anderton was chaplain at Towneley from June 23rd 1705 until his death on July 13th 1741. Between 1705 and 1727 he performed at 16 weddings and over 90 christenings at Towneley. Shortly after his arrival, he started a record of the payments of his stipend, of his baptisms and marriages, and of his daily commemorations at Mass. The last take up by far the largest portion of his book, being entered daily from May 1, 1706, to Dec. 31, 1722. Among the commemorations were those for King James III at the time of the Jacobite rising in 1715. He rarely missed celebrating mass except during July and August 1717 when the Commissioners for Forfeited Estates came to Towneley looking for him. At that time he was no doubt in hiding.</p>
