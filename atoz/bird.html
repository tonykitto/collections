<section class="column">
<p>Archibald Bird worked in Stonebridge Mill, Colne and B.T.H. Colne. He exhibited in Local Artists exhibitions at Towneley between 1909 and 1913. He clearly thought himself a good painter because by 1913 he was asking up to 22 guineas for his best work. He later had a studio above Boots Shop, Market Street, Colne and gave painting lessons. There is one work by him in the oil collection <a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?paoil335a">paoil335a</a> , which may be "Morning on the River" exhibited at Towneley in 1910.</p><p>His grandson, Mr Garrett, 3 Higgin Street, Colne, was interviewed around 1980 when he had three other examples of his grandfather's work. Titles of work exhibited at Towneley included</p><ul><li> 1909 Meadowland; Among the Bluebell</li><li> 1910 An Old Lane; A Summer Day; Morning on the River</li><li> 1911 Evening Glow</li><li> 1912 "Poppy Land" off Cromer Cliffs; Through Shade to Light</li><li> 1913 A Wooded Upland; On the Thames</li></ul>
