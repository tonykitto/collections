<p>In excess of 1,000 sea and freshwater shells from a wide range of sources.</p><p>The 1938 catalogue [<a href="inventories--catalogues.html"><b>md7a</b></a>] recorded the details of shell collections given by  Mr. Dixon (in 1929), Mr. Eastwood (in 1912)and Mr. F. C. Long (in 1910). </p><p>The contents of the catalogue appear to have been checked in May 1973 but no index cards were created and the shells were not added to the accession register. They have not been displayed for many years. There are no photographs.</p>
