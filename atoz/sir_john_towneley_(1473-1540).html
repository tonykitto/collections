<p>A stone plaque showing the arms of Sir John Towneley and his first wife, Isabella Pilkington of Gateford in Nottinghamshire, was placed over the fireplace in the <a href="servants'_hall.html">Servants' Hall</a> around 1923, having previously been in a bedroom on the second floor of the north wing that made way for the <a href="stocks_massey_gallery.html">Stocks Massey Gallery</a>.</p><p>Sir John built the <a href="chapel.html">Chapel</a> around 1532 and probably the plaque was originally displayed outside the chapel before the chapel was moved to its present location in the 18th century.</p><p>Sir John appears to have used Hapton Tower as his main residence, much of Towneley having been built after his death.
