The two towers carry staircases giving access to their adjoining wings, to the roof-space over the Great Hall and to some small service/storerooms. For more see <b>The West and North Wings. . .1607-1628</b> -  Chapter Two of "An Architectural History of Towneley Hall" by W. John and Kit Smith, published by Heritage Trust for the North West in 2004.</p><p>The original staircase in the South wing was replaced by the <a href="cantilever_staircase.html">Cantilever Staircase</a> around one hundred years later. A small room on the ground floor, the <a href="green_parlour.html">Green Parlour</a> is accessed from the south corner of the Great Hall.
