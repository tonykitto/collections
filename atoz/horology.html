<h1>Horology - clocks and watches</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Summary: around 25 clocks, of which 9 are long case clocks on display in historic rooms plus around 50 18th and 19th century watches normally in store. One of the clocks in the collection , the <a href="greenwich_clock.html">Greenwich Clock</a>, has a particular connection with Towneley, being a reconstruction of one of pair of clocks in Greenwich Observatory which Richard Towneley (1629-1707) helped to design in 1676. </p>
<p><a href="../cms/cms_FUAN.html?clock">Clocks</a> are recorded in the <a href="accession_registers.html">accession registers</a> as part of the furniture collection but watches are recorded as a separate collection with object numbers beginning <b>cwj</b> . Index cards were created for the watches in the 1970s  and the objects were added to the accession registers in 2007. The watches are recorded in the Modes database with a Object Identity template name of <a href="../cms/cms_WATCH.html">amuse_WATCH</a>. </p>
