<section class="column">
<p>The Vestments Room is the area on the first floor of the north wing going either into the <a href="chapel.html">Chapel</a> or to the <a href="family_dining_room.html">Family Dining Room</a>. Earlier inventories label the section shown to be partitioned in the 1902 <a href="heating_plan.html">heating plan</a> as the ante-room next to the chapel. In 1905 this lath and plaster partition was removed and the area as a whole was known as the room adjoining the chapel. In 1910 it was used to display part of the <a href="egyptology.html">Egyptology</a> collection. The <a href="whalley_abbey_vestments.html">Whalley Abbey Vestments</a> were displayed from 1923 and the room was called the Vestments Room in the 1984 guide book.</p>
