<p>Stocks Austerberry was born in Pontefract, Yorkshire but came to live in Burnley, where he made paintings of local buildings of historic interest. His work was collected by local historian <a href="allen,_j.html">John Allen</a> and purchased for Towneley after Allen's death in 1911. There are <a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?austerberry">three oil paintings</a> and <a href="../cms/cms_WACO.html?austerberry">seven watercolours</a> by him in the collections.</p>
