<h1>Family history timeline</h1>
<section class="column">
		<p>A to Z does not provide entries for all members of the Towneley family. Rather the aim is to provide information on those with objects in the museum collections or on those members and friends who have left some mark on the building.</p>
		<p> The earliest part of the building we see today, the South wing, was probably completed by John Towneley (1415-c1473) in the 1450s but it is his granson, <a href="sir_john_towneley_(1473-1540).html">Sir John Towneley (1473-1540)</a> who represents the earliest individual Towneley Family A to Z entry, having added the chapel around 1532. The earliest of the family paintings depict <a href="john_and_mary_towneley.html">John and Mary Towneley</a> and their family in 1601.  <a href="richard_towneley_(1566-1628).html">Richard Towneley (1566-1628)</a>, their eldest son, was responsible for building a large part of the North wing in the 1620s. </p>
		<p>Richard's grandson, <a href="richard_towneley_(1629-1707).html">Richard Towneley (1629-1707)</a>, remembered mainly as an astronomer, was probably responsible for the Long Gallery bedrooms installed around 1700. There is little at Towneley to remember his son, Charles Towneley (1658-1712), but according to family history, Charles was responsible for moving the Chapel to the North wing. His wife, <a href="ursula_fermor_(1662-1748).html">Ursula Fermor (1662-1748)</a>, is better remembered for recording a list of hiding places at Towneley. <a href="anderton.html">Rev. Thomas Anderton</a>, their chaplain, is thought to have used the hiding places.</p>
		<p><a href="richard_towneley_(1689-1735).html">Richard Towneley (1689-1735)</a> rebuilt the Great Hall around 1726 and his eldest son, <a href="william_towneley_(1714-1742).html">William Towneley (1714-1742)</a>, was responsible for doubling the width of the North Wing around 1737.</p>
		<p><a href="charles_townley_(1737-1805).html">Charles Townley (1737-1805)</a> improved the park and built the brew house in 1790. He also made changes to the South wing that were swept away after his cousin <a href="peregrine_edward_towneley_(1762-1846).html">Peregrine Edward Towneley (1762-1846)</a> inherited the Towneley estate in 1813. In 1844, the family made a catalogue of the portraits and paintings at Towneley, colloquially known as the <a href="black_book.html">"Black Book"</a> that also  contains a general account of the family and a description of the house.</p>
		<p>Peregrine's elder son, <a href="charles_towneley_(1803-1876).html">Charles Towneley (1803-1876)</a>, added the four storey tower by the north corner of the North wing around 1850. After the death of Charles in 1876 and that of his brother John in 1878 and John's only son <a href="richard_henry_towneley_(1849-1877).html">Richard Henry Towneley (1849-1877) </a>in the previous year, the family were left with no male heirs. As a result of the Towneley Estate Act in 1885, the part of the Towneley estate that included Towneley Hall went to <a href="o'hagan,_lady.html">Alice Towneley,  Lady O'Hagan (1846-1921)</a>.</p>
