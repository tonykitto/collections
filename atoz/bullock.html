<h1>George Bullock (1783-1818)</h1>
<section class="column">
George Bullock (1783-1818) sculptor, marble-mason and cabinet-maker, he had showrooms in Liverpool and, around 1806, he leased the Mona marble quarries at Llanvechell on the island of Anglesey. The marbles were manufactured into elegant chimneypieces and other decorations. One of his fireplaces can be seen in the Green Drawing Room.
