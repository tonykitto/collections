Christ and the Woman of Canaan (<a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?paoil8">paoil18</a>) has previously been attributed to Ludovico Carracci (1555-1619). It was probably purchased by Charles Townley when he was in Rome in 1767 and was recorded in the inventory of pictures at Towneley in 1861. It was left in the chapel when Burnley Corporation took over Towneley in 1903. It is now thought to be an early copy of an original work by Ludovico Carracci now lost. For more detail of the painting see <a href="https://vads.ac.uk/digital/collection/NIRP/id/32143">Nice Paintings</a>.
