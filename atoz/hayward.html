<h1>Hayward, Richard (1728-1800)</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Hayward was born in Warwickshire. In 1753 he spent a year in Rome and was a friend of Thomas Jenkins who supplied Charles Townley with part of his sculpture collection. It may have  been through Jenkins that Charles Townley employed Hayward. Hayward made chimney pieces for Woburn Abbey (1771), Kedleston (1760), Ingres Abbey in Kent (1771) and a large number for  Somerset House in London beginning in 1778.</p><p>There is an entry in Charles Townley's personal account book which reads -<blockquote>  "1780  <br>   To Richd. Hayward sculptor remainder  <br>   in full for dining room chimney pd  <br>   dft. on Wrights 25 July Â£50-18s."</blockquote></p>
<p>This is probably for the marble neo-classical <a href="fireplaces.html">fireplace</a> which is now in the <a href="regency_rooms.html">red drawing room</a>. It is certainly very similar to a fireplace in the State boudoir at Kedleston. This similarity includes the use of the rather unusual inlaid marble columns.</p>
