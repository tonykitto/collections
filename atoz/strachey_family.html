<h1>Strachey Family</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>In 1911, <a href="o'hagan,_maurice.html">Maurice O'Hagan</a> married Frances Constance Strachey. In 1921, he inherited the Towneley heirlooms on the death of his mother, <a href="o'hagan,_lady.html">Lady O'Hagan</a>.</p><p>In 1938, his son, Thomas Anthony Edward Towneley-O'Hagan, changed his surname by Deed Poll to that of his mother. He died before his father Maurice and in 1961 his elder son, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Strachey,_4th_Baron_O%27Hagan">Charles Towneley Strachey</a> inherited the O'Hagan barony as the 4th Lord O'Hagan and also the remaining Towneley family heirlooms.</p><p>In 2001, he gave some of the heirlooms to his daughter Hon. Nino Strachey and these have been loaned to Towneley including the <a href="todmorden_bed.html">Todmorden Bed</a> and 19th century Towneley inventories. A number of Towneley sculptures, previously on loan since 1926, were purchased in 2008.</p>
