		<p>The names North and South wings are entirely arbitrary but are in keeping with 18th and early 19th century plans. In early 20th century guide books they were called the South-East and North-West wings.</p>
		<p>The <a href="sundial.html">sundial</a> is on the buttress at the southern corner of the South wing. The North wing was began around 1620 but has been extended many times. The chapel was moved to the north wing around 1712 and the width of the wing was doubled in size around 1737. The Victorian Tower was added to the North corner in 1851.</p>
		<p>The South Wing, which is the oldest part surviving, was built before 1450. but has seen frequent changes. The Long Gallery on the upper floor was created around 1700 and major changes were made on the ground floor early in the 19th century to create the Regency Rooms.</p>
