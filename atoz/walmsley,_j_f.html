<h1>J Frank Walmsley (1876-1933)</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Frank Walmsley was the honorary secretary of the Art Gallery and Museum <a href="sub-committee.html">sub-committee</a> from 1919 until his death in 1933. He was a cotton manufacturer, being managing director of Messrs. George Walmesley and Sons in Burnley, which was founded by his father. He had joined the sub-committee after his election as a councillor in 1917 but continued as a co-opted member after he retired from the council in 1923. There was a detailed obituary in the Burnley Express on January 14th, 1933, page 8 column 7.</p><p>Much of his correspondence survives in the <a href="museum_archive.html">museum archive</a> including the exchange of letters between him and <a href="gilbert,_walter.html">Walter Gilbert</a> concerning the purchase of work by <a href="gilbert,_alfred.html">Alfred Gilbert</a>.</p><p>Probably his most important contribution was to propose the purchase of antique furniture in 1924 after a loan collection from the V&A had been greatly admired. By the time of his death, furniture was on display in all the rooms of the <a href="long_gallery.html">Long Gallery</a> and in the <a href="family_dining_room.html">Family Dining Room</a> and today the collection of <a href="furniture.html">antique furniture</a> is still one of the most important of the museum's collections.</p>
