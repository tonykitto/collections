<h1>Documentation System</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Towneley museum's documentation system contains both paper and electronic elements. There is no plan to go completely paperless but most management information passes via email.</p><p>Object entry uses a paper object entry form. Normally any object that is a candidate for accession into a collection is first digitally photographed for insurance purposes as a jpeg file with a brief description added as a caption. Once the object has been accessioned, the image filename is changed to be the same name as the object's object number and moved to the appropriate computer system image folder as the object's primary image.</p>
<p>The <a href="collections_management_system.html">collections management system</a> uses Modes software 'Modes Complete version 1.3' to detail the objects recorded in the 2007 version of the accession register together with each object's current and previous locations. Objects added to the permanent collections since 2007 are only entered into Modes. Not all of the museum object information is recorded within Modes. In particular, insurance valuations and donor address details are excluded and are accessed via paper documents.</p>
