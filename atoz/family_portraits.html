<h1>Towneley Family Portraits</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Portraits of the Towneley family are an important part of the oil and watercolour collections. A <a href="black_book.html">family catalogue</a> in 1844 recorded over 130 family portraits with over 90 of these on display in the <a href="long_gallery.html">Long Gallery</a>.</p>
<p>Today there are <a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?~FamilyPortraits">13 oil paintings</a> and <a href="../cms/cms_WACO.html?~FamilyPortraits">7 works on paper</a> in the museum collections, 10 of which were on display in 1844. Of those dated after 1844, the most important depicts <a href="charles_towneley_(1803-1876).html">Charles Towneley (1803-1876)</a> and his brother John viewing their Derby winning racehorse <a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?paoil38">Kettledrum</a> in 1861.</p><p>Those family portraits on display are mainly located in the <a href="towneley_room.html">Towneley Room</a> or the <a href="art_gallery.html">Art Gallery</a>. None have been displayed in the Long Gallery for many years. Since 2002, a number of portraits from the oil collection have been displayed in the <a href="regency_rooms.html">Green Regency Room</a> but only one, <a href="../cms/cms_PAOIL.html?paoil103">Lady Caroline Towneley with two of her daughters</a>, depicts a member of the Towneley family. This painting dates from around the year of the birth of Lady Caroline's third daughter, <a href="o'hagan,_lady.html">Alice</a> in 1846.</p>
