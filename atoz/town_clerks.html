<h1>Town Clerks</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>When the museum sub-committee was first set-up in 1902, the Town Clerk and his staff handled much of the museum's paperwork with the Town Clerk attending the meetings. The Town Clerk was Alfred Steele Sheldon and he loaned a scold's bridle for the first exhibition in 1903, which eventually became part of the permanent collection, however due to ill-health he was not able to attend meetings in 1903 and C M Foden took on the role of Hon. Secretary.</p>
<p>Later in the 1930s when Wilfred Dean resigned the role, the Town Clerk attended meetings and produced the committee's annual reports. Colin Campbell (Town Clerk from 1923-1935) produced the reports in 1933 and 1935 and then Harry Plowman (Town Clerk from 1935-1939) that for 1936.</p>
<p>The Town Clerk's office was very much involved in the museum's management as can be shown from a large batch of correspondence in the Town Clerk's files relating to Towneley, which have survived from 25 August 1905 up until 1950.</p>
