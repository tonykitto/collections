<p>The South Tower Bedroom is at the top of the <a href="cantilever_staircase.html">Cantilever Staircase</a> in the South Tower. In 1871 it was labelled Bedroom in Low Tower next Gallery. In the 20th century it was only seen on guided tours visiting the <a href="priest's_hide.html">Priest's Hide</a> under the floor. In recent years it has been opened as a display room, furnished as a Victorian lady's maid's bedroom.</p>
