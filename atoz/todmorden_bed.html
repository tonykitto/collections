The bed was on display at Towneley throughout the 19th century but was removed in 1902.</p><p>This bed was purchased from Todmorden Hall by <a href="whitaker,_t_d.html">Thomas Dunham Whitaker</a>, author of the History of Whalley, who lived nearby at Holme in Cliviger. He wrote that it had been made for Saville Radcliffe (1582-1652) in 1615. Whitaker gave the bed to Charles Townley around 1802, probably as a thank you for Townley's help in the publishing of Whitaker's book. The following extract is from History of Whalley 2nd Edition p. 292 (1806).</p><p>"This magnificent Bed of Massy Oak, purchased from Todmorden Hall, and dated 1615, with a profusion of rude Carving, and Armorial Bearings.</p><p>1st upon the Head The Royal Arms and Supporters the Lion and Unicorn with the Cypher I.
