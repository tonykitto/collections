<h1>About A-Z entries</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Each entry aims to give a quick summary about a particular Towneley topic together with bibliographic references. It may also provide links to more information elsewhere on the Internet.</p>
</section>
<div id="content"><section class="column">
	<h3><a  href="artists_list.html">Artists</a></h3>
	<p>A to Z does not include entries for all artists represented in the fine and decorative arts collections. Many of the artists have profiles in <a href="https://artuk.org">Art UK</a> and are only included here if there is a particular association with Towneley.</p>
	<h3><a href="building_summary.html">Building</a></h3>
	<p>Towneley was not built all at one time. The South wing was built before 1450. The  towers, hall  and North wing were built in the 1620s but some parts were almost completely rebuilt or extended in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Ato Z building entries relate to building changes after 1902 and how the rooms have been used by the museum. Anyone looking for a detailed description of the house before 1902 should read <strong>"An Architectural History of Towneley Hall"</strong> by W. John and Kit Smith, published by Heritage Trust for the North West in 2004. The much shorter <a href="downloads/Architectural_Introduction.pdf">"An Introduction to the Architectural History of Towneley Hall, Burnley"</a> by Susan Bourne, published in 1979, available here as a pdf, provides a good overview.</p>
	<h3><a href="collections_summary.html">Collections</a></h3>
	<p>These entries cover the museum's collections as a whole and individual object highlights. Other specific information about individual objects, such as when and how they were acquired, can be browsed with the <a href="../cms/index.html">Towneley collections browser</a>.</p>
</section>
<section class="column">
	<h3><a href="family_history_timeline.html">Family history</a></h3>
	<p>A to Z does not provide entries for all members of the Towneley family. Rather the aim is to provide information on those with objects in the museum collections or on those members and friends who have left some mark on the building.</p> <p> The earliest part of the building we see today, the South wing, was probably completed by John Towneley (1415-c1473) in the 1450s but his granson Sir John Towneley (1473-1540) who added the chapel around 1532, represents the earliest individual Towneley Family A to Z entry. For more of the history of the family, going back to the 13th century, see <a href="downloads/Tracing_the_Towneleys_2004.pdf">Tracing_the_Towneleys_2004.pdf</a>.</p>
	<h3><a href="museum_history_timeline.html">Museum history</a></h3>
	<p>These entries identify many of the documents in the museum archive that show how the museum developed over 120 years from 1902 and the peopled who managed those developments.</p>
