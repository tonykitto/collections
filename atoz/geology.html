<h1>Geology - part of the natural history collection</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>The early contributions to the museum included a number of fossils, corals and minerals, e.g. "1 bottle of sand from Egypt". These did not amount to a coherent collection but included the following interesting contribution "Minerals presented by Lady O'Hagan found in the region of the South Pole by Sir Ernest Shackleton".</p>
<p>Items continued to be donated at irregular intervals up until the 1970s. They came from all over the UK and the rest of the world and only a relatively small percentage are from the local area. In the museum inventory the items are now divided into fossils, minerals and rocks.</p>
