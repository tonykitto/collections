<h1>Object Number</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Each museum object is individually numbered to identify and distinguish it from all other objects in a collection. All the information relating to an object is filed and accessed using this unique number. </p><p>Writing a number directly on an object is the most secure method of <b>labelling</b> but it is not always the most suitable. See <a href=https://collectionstrust.org.uk/spectrum-resources/cataloguing-spectrum/>Collections Trust Spectrum resources</a> for guidelines on marking and labelling methods. A record photograph of each object, including its correct registration number, provides additional security. </p><p>Historically, a mixture of numeric and alphanumeric sequencing was used at Towneley from the 1950s. Each object was assigned to one of a specific collection group such as oil painting, watercolour, ceramics, furniture etc. with the object number beginning with one or more alphabetic characters indicating that collection group.</p><p>The simple guiding rule is that if all parts of a multi-part object will always be displayed together then it will be recorded as a single object with one object number. Groups of objects that might be displayed separately, for example a cup and saucer will each have its own object number and object record. Each object will be labelled with its own object number.</p><p>There may still be the need to mark or label individual parts of a multi-part object where the parts might easily become separated when packed up for moving. One particular example is the labelling of a ceramic jar and its cover. Each part may be labelled with an alphabetic suffix added to the common object number, for example po690a and po690b. In such a case the brief description should make this clear and add the alphabetic suffix group in parentheses, for example (a-b), at the end of the brief description.</p><p>Historically, for a few years in the 1970s, some objects were given a number recorded in the <a href="day_books.html">day books</a>, beginning with the year number. This has been retained in the case of the textile collection.</p>
