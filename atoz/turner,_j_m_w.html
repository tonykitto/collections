<h1>J M W Turner</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Charles Townley (1737-1805) engaged Turner to come to Lancashire in 1799 to illustrate the first book by his friend and neighbour, Thomas Dunham Whitaker of The Holme in Cliviger. This was The History of Whalley first published in 1801. Turner probably stayed with Whitaker at Holme and visited Towneley to sketch the Hall.</p>
<p>The result of Turner's visit is one of <a href="../cms/cms_WACO.html?turner">four watercolours</a> by Turner in the Towneley Art collection:</p><ul><li> WA/Co 51 Mitton Hall  (not signed and not in 'Wilton' -see below) purchased 1929.</li><li> WA/Co 69 Whalley Church - 8 studies of crosses and brasses and misericords purchased in 1933, this was once in the collection of John Ruskin.</li><li> WA/Co 102 Towneley Hall purchased in 1939. </li><li> WA/Co 162 Cape Colonna: The Temple of Minerva at Sunium purchased in 1960.</li></ul>
<p>A further watercolour by Turner, WA/Co 51 Sherburne Chapel, Mitton Church,  was stolen from Towneley on 2 September 1986 and has not been recovered.</p>
