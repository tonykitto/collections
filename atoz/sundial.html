The sundial was set up in September 2001 to  commemorate <a href="richard_towneley_(1629-1707).html">Richard Towneley (1629-1707)</a> who was the first person to publish regular records of rainfall in Great Britain. It was placed on the South buttress, which is the best place to catch the sun when it is directly to the South every day at noon.  </p>
