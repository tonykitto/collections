<p>The <a href="../cms/cms_FUAN.html?fuan234">Greenwich Clock</a> [<b>fuan234</b>]in the entrance hall at Towneley is a reconstruction of one of a pair of clocks presented to the Royal Observatory at Greenwich by Sir Jonas Moore in 1676 and which Richard Towneley had helped to design. The reconstruction was made in 1999 by Alan Smith of Worsley, Greater Manchester, for the exhibition <b>The Towneley Time Trials</b> in 1999 and was on show at Towneley for a year until July 2000.</p><p>The clock returned to Towneley in August 2007 to become part of the permanent collection, thanks to Alan's generous gift. The Towneley Hall Society also assisted by funding the making of a new clock dial and case. The dial was made by John Skeavington of Goodacre Engraving, Loughborough and is a copy of the original Sir Jonas Moore dial now in the British Museum. The case, constructed of ebonised pine, was made by Mark Hopkins of Heywood, Greater Manchester.</p>
