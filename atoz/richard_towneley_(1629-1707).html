<h1>Richard Towneley (1629-1707)</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>Richard Towneley is remembered mainly as an astronomer, see his <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Towneley>wikipedia</a> entry.</p><p>There is no clear evidence that Richard made any changes to Towneley but it is probably that he was responsible for the <a href="long_gallery_bedrooms.html">Long Gallery bedrooms</a> installed around 1700. </p><p>Although two portraits of him are recorded in 19th century Towneley inventories, no portrait appears to have survived. Richard is commemorated at Towneley by a <a href="sundial.html">sundial</a> set up on the South buttress of the South wing of Towneley Hall and by a three quarter size reconstruction of a <a href="greenwich_clock.html">clock</a> designed by Richard for Greenwich Observatory in 1676. </p>
