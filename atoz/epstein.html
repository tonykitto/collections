<section class="column">
<p>Sir Jacob Epstein (1880-1959) is represented in the collection by one work, a bronze bust of Bernard van Dieren (1884-1936) [<a href="../cms/cms_SCU.html?scu46">scu46</a>]. The subject was a Dutch composer who sat for Epstein several times. The Art Gallery and Museums sub-committee of the Town Council on 24th June
1943 recorded that:<br>
"The bust was offered to this sub-committee by the sculptor for Â£220, of which amount one-half should be given to the Merchant Navy Comforts Services - agreed the bust and a suitable stand be
purchased out of the moneys of the General Exhibits Account."</p>
