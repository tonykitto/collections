<p>Summary:  70 works - around 40% marble busts, 30% plaster casts and 30% bronzes, ranging from 16th to 21st century.</p><p>Towneley has a good collection of sculpture on display throughout the house from wood carvings of the 16th century to work of the 21st century.</p><p>The first gifts in the museum's early years were <a href="../cms/cms_SCU.html?Massey marble bust">five marble busts</a>, given by <a href="massey_bequest.html">Edward Stocks Massey</a>, to enhance the <a href="great_hall.html">Entrance Hall</a> and the first purchases were <a href="plaster_casts.html">plaster casts</a> to furnish the <a href="chapel.html">chapel</a> in 1905. The 1920s saw the commissioning of two busts by <a href="gilbert,_alfred.html">Alfred Gilbert</a> and the long term loan of the Towneley family busts, which were finally purchased inthe 21st century.</p><p>An early marble copy of the <a href="italian_venus.html">Italian Venus</a> by Canova has been on loan from the Starkie family of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntroyde_Hall>Huntroyde</a> since 1933. This large sculpture has remained in place in the <a href="regency_rooms.html">Red Drawing Room</a> ever since due to its size and weight. For the same reason, most of the other marble sculptures are rarely moved and are always on display.</p><p>Those sculptures that are not on display, many being in poor condition, are stored in unsuitable conditions in the cellars. There are no conservation plans.</p><p>The basic details for all the sculptures are recorded in the <a href="../CMS/cms_SCU.html">Modes database</a>. Index cards for sculpture were started in 1973 but are incomplete.</p>
