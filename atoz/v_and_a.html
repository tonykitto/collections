<p>The <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in South Kensington, London, was a great help to Towneley at the start of the 20th century. Until 1977, the V&A had a department, the Circulation Department, touring shows of art and design to regional museums and schools of art around the UK. Each year up until 1939 the V&A lent up to four cases of decorative art exhibits to Towneley.</p><p>In 1904, the V&A gave advice on furnishing the <a href="chapel.html">chapel</a> and <a href="family_dining_room.html">dining room</a>. They loaned furniture in 1923, which was so admired by visitors that the <a href="sub-committee.html">sub-committee</a> decided to start a collection of furniture to display in the <a href="long_gallery.html">Long Gallery</a>. Some of the <a href="loans.html">loans</a> are still at Towneley including an electrotype copy of 15th century suit of armour on display in the Long Gallery Bedroom 5.</p>
