<h1>A tour around the outside of Towneley Hall</h1>
<section class="column">
<p>A tour around the outside of Towneley Hall is a guide book that was published in 2004. It describes the many changes made to Towneley Hall over a six hundred year period. It was illustrated with drawings by Kit Smith, which showed what Towneley was like at the end of the 20th century. The guide book is still available in the <a href="museum_shop.html">Museum Shop</a> and the <a href="../cms/cms_WACO.html?elevations">original drawings</a> are part of the watercolour collection.</p><p>The Towneley Hall Society occasionally take visitors on an outside tour giving a commentary based upon the guide book. This is very much about what can be observed about the building rather than simply retelling the family's history.</p>
