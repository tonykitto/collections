<p>John Towneley (1731-1813) lived at Corney House in Chiswick and commissioned a book-plate for his library there. There is a catalogue of his books at Chiswick and at Park Street, Westminster, together with a diary of his visit to Towneley in 1807 in the Museum's collection at Towneley. After 1807 his book-plate was altered to reflect his Towneley inheritance.</p>
<p> John was particularly fortunate in being left a number of properties by relatives prior to him inheriting the Towneley estate in 1807 so he had ample means to indulge his passion for books. His main interests seem to have been early printed books, particularly well illustrated ones, and English topography.</p>
<p>John died in May 1813 and shortly after son Peregrine sold his father's library as the Bibliotheca Towneleiana in two major sales conducted by Evans in 1814 and 1815. A copy of the catalogue from the sales is available through Harvard University Library's <a href ="http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/14430268" >page delivery service</a> . Evans sold a final small part of the library  in May 1816 at the same time  as the sale of Auditor Harley's collection. Only a small number of books from the family library appear to have been included in these sales.</p>
<p>On the death of Charles Towneley (1803-1877), Peregrine's elder son, his library at Charles Street, Berkeley-square, London, was sold by Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge on April 19th and 20th, 1877. There were few if any of the family's printed books in this sale but a number of genealogical manuscripts were included and these are now in the <a href="http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/1500-1900/towneley-c2/towneley-c2.html">Bodleian Library</a>.</p>
<p>With the death of John Towneley (1806-1878), brother of Charles, the male line of the Towneley family ended and the family library was sold at Sotheby's on 18-28 June 1883. The Manchester antiquarian John Eglington Bailey (1840-1888) reported the sale in his magazine, The Palatine Notebook (August 1883, pages 187-192), as <b><i>"one of the most deplorable dispersions of an old family library"</i></b>. The auction of the printed books took place over the first eight days when over 9,000 volumes were sold in 2815 lots and according to Bailey produced about £4,500. The main interest lay in the manuscripts which occupied the final two days of the sale in 241 lots and, again according to Bailey, made the family £4,054 6s. 6d. the richer in cash.</p>
