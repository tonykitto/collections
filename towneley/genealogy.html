<p>The family, who lived at Towneley, can be traced back to the 13th century when they were farm managers in Lancashire for Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln. Richard de Towneley, who died in 1381, was High Sheriff and attended parliament as a knight of the shire. His grandson, Richard Towneley (1387-1455) fought at the Battle of Agincourt. It is possible that Richard started building on the Towneley Hall site but it is most likely that the earliest part of the building we see today was completed by his son, John Towneley (1415-c1473) in the 1450s. John married Isabelle, daughter of Richard de Shireburne, in 1445. Isabelle died before 1462 having born five sons and a daughter. For a genealogist this is probably the most important of the Towneley marriages. Many of the American descendants of the Towneley family today find their links with either Lawrence, the second son or Nicholas, the third son. </p>
<p> Richard Towneley (1566-1628), who in 1603 bound his books with the family coat of arms, was the first member of the family who appears to have taken a great interest in genealogy. His shield of eighteen quarterings  was recorded by Richard St. George, Norroy King of Arms, in the Heralds' Visitation of Lancashire of 1613. Christopher Towneley (1604-1674), Richard Towneley's seventh son, was known as the transcriber. He made copies of early charters and church records from all over Lancashire and Yorkshire. We  have Christopher to thank for the details of the early part of Towneley pedigree records.</p>
