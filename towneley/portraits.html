<p>The earliest portrait shows John and Mary Towneley and their family in 1601. </p>
<p>In 1844, there were over 130 portraits at Towneley, including around 50 of the Widdrington family, brought around 1840 from Stella, near Newcastle. All the paintings were removed by 1902, but ten of them have now returned to Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museum. The latest to return was that of John Towneley (1697-1782) in 2004.
<p>A detailed record of all the 130 portraits at Towneley in 1844 can be found in the following pdf file</p>
