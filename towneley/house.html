<p>"An Architectural History of Towneley Hall" by W. John and Kit Smith, published by Heritage Trust for the North West in 2004, provides a detailed description of the house. The much shorter "An Introduction to the Architectural History of Towneley Hall, Burnley" by Susan Bourne, published in 1979, provides a good overview. A pdf version of Susan Bourne's book can be downloaded here.</p>
