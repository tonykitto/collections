<main><p>This web site displays part of Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museum's fine arts collection taken from Towneley's Modes xml files. You can curate your own exhibition by selecting individual objects from these pages and adding your own labels, see <a href="my_exhibition.html">My Exhibition</a>.</p>
<p>More than half of Towneley's sculpture and oil paintings are normally on public display but over 1,000 watercolours and book illustrations in the permanent collections are kept in store. Whilst parts of these collections are regularly displayed, care is taken not display any of the exhibits too often in order to preserve them from fading.</p>
