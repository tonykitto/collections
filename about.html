<h1>About My Exhibition</h1>
<p class="overview">On your first visit to the <a href="my_exhibition.html">My Exhibition page</a>, if the localStorage facility is available, the heading shows <b>nothing chosen</b> and <b>There have not been any objects selected for display</b></p>
<p class="overview">When you next view any of the collection displays you will see "Chose me" and a tick box below the left corner of each image. After making one or more choices, on returning to the My Exhibition page you will see the selected objects displayed. When you press the <b>Make exhibition changes</b> button, you can change the exhibition heading, edit the labels or remove the objects entirely.  The objects displayed are sorted according to the label, for example you can organise your choices by prefixing each label with a number.You can make more additions from the collection displays at any time. Whenever you return to the collection displays that includes any of your chosen objects, you will see the object is labelled "Selected" and with no tick box. Only if you remove the object from the My Exhibition page or close the exhibition and start a new exhibition will the tick box re-appear.</p>
<p class="overview">The exhibition title and labels can be downloaded to local filestore as a text file from the <a href="store.html">exhibition store page</a> and this text file can later be chosen to set up another exhibition.
