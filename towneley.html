<h2>Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museum - Collections Displays - September 2023</h2>

<div class="display_link"><p>More than half of Towneley's sculpture and oil paintings are normally on public display but over 1,000 watercolours and book illustrations in the permanent collections are kept in store. Whilst parts of the collection are regularly displayed, care is taken not display any individual painting too often in order to preserve them from fading.</p>

<div class="display_link"><p><b>Prints</b> were some of the earliest additions to the collections with over 100 Landseer prints donated in 1905 but by 1920 the prints were considered unfashionable and were loaned out to local schools. Many were damaged but 61 are still in the collection. A set of prints given for the benefit of art students of  Burnley Mechanics Institute by art critic P G Hamerton in 1893 were eventually tranfered to Towneley in 1986. Otherwise most of the prints related to local history  and a small number of topographical prints are displayed here.</p>
